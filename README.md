### Hi there 👋

This is Aisha's account which is a showcase of the projects she is working on 👩‍💻

As a full stack developer, most of my projects will revolve around:
- User Interfaces building using (React, Bootstrap, css, html).
- Backend development using (javascript, express, nodejs).
- APIs building using (express, javascript).
- Databases structuring using (MongoDB).


In addition, I will share with you my experience in building projects based on the blockchain, specifically on the Ethereum network, which will revolve around:
- Build smart contracts based on the Ethereum network using **Solidity** which is a programming language created by Ethereum for its developers.
- Deploy smart contracts either on the mainnet or testnet.
- Link the user interface to the smart contract and interact with it by sending and receiving information using **web3.js**.
