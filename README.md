### Hi there 👋

This is Aisha's account which is a showcase of the projects she is working on 👩‍💻

I'm passionate about optimizing software development lifecycles and orchestrating seamless deployment pipelines. I thrive on leveraging cutting-edge technologies to enhance system scalability, ensure continuous delivery, and drive operational efficiency.

Most of my projects will revolve around:
- User Interfaces building using (React, Bootstrap, css, html).
- Backend development using (javascript, express, nodejs).
- APIs building using (express, javascript).
- Databases structuring using (MongoDB).
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
- Containerization and Orchestration
